== Change Log

Notes on the "meaning" of column headings.

* Source - Source of the change. In the case of the I3S Community Standard, the value is always "Other" indicating that the changes were submitted from an external source.
* Identifier - As the changes to the I3S Community Standards were submitted by the Esri I3S community, there are no Change Request or GitHub issue identifiers. Hence the value used in this document is N.A. for Not Applicable.
* Type - Type of change. Always "A" for administrative.
* Section - The section number modified in the updated document.
* Description - Brief text describing the change.
* Purpose - the reason for the change. Suggested reasons are:
** Clarity
** Consistency
** Deprecated
** Interoperability
** Perfunctory
** Readability
** Usability

A word on "deprecated". For the purposes of this I3S revision, deprecated properties do not impact backwards compatibility. Deprecated properties in version 1.1 were optional in version 1.0. Further, deprecated properties identified in version 1.1 will remain in the Community Standard for a minimum of one year to ensure that any implementations of I3S have sufficient time to make any necessary modifications.

Node switching lets clients focus on the display of a node as a whole. A node switch occurs when the content from a node's children is used to replace the content of an existing node. This can include features, geometry, attributes and textures. Node switching can be helpful when the user needs to see more detailed information. | Clarity
|Other | N.A.| A| Section 7.5.4 Levels of Detail Generation | Reformatted Table 2 to be consistent and to include Point Cloud Layers and (planned) Building Scene Layers. | Interoperability
|Other | N.A.| A| Section 7.5.4.7 (now 7.6.4.7) Class IndexScheme | This class has been deprecated in the version 1.1 of the OGC I3S Community Standard. However, this class remains in the standard for backwards compatibility. Developers  should not  implement this class. This class will be removed in a future I3S version. See additional note below table.| Deprecated
|Other | N.A.| A| Section 7.5.5 LoD Selection Metrics | •	Corrected an error in the example.
•	Added definitions for maxScreenThresholdSQ, maxScreenThresholdSQ, screenSpaceRelative, distanceRangeFromDefaultCamera, effectiveDensity. The latter two definitions are new in version 1.1 of the OGC document. They were added in support of Point Clouds.
•	Added a new table to better summarize available properties. | Clarity and Enhancement. See Substabtive Changes for more information
|Other | N.A.| A| 7.6.3.1 Class SceneServiceInfo | A few edits that improve document flow and “readability” were applied. | Readability
|Other | N.A.| A| 7.6.4.1 Class 3dSceneLayerInfo | Added a sentence to clarify the relationship between this class and sub-class drawingInfo. | Clarity. See also Substantive Changes for more information.
|Other | N.A.| A| 7.6.4.2 Class Store | •	Added more informative text for the resourcePattern property. Old description was limited and confusing.
•	Added more informative text for the normalReferenceFrame property. Old description was limited and confusing.

|=======================================================================

*Additional Note*:The IndexScheme class has been deprecated as the class was useful only for informational reasons. Furthermore, it made it onerous for content generators to explicitly document the data partitioning scheme used to generate an I3S content. As an I3S client’s data discovery and traversal is purely driven by the node index document, information supplied by the IndexScheme class is not necessary for traversal nor for efficient loading of content. As a result, this class is deprecated.
